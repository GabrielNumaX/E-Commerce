Approach and Issues
--------------------
Approach
- Design the common  html  and css
- Create dynamic content for INDEX.html
- Create counter in localStorage
- Design non-common html and css
- Create JS functions to create product list in localStorage
  and then use that data to create content in CHECKOUT.html
- Design CSS animation for CONFIRMATION.html
- Apply Responsive Design to the HTML's

- Overall I intended to enhance my skills in JS, JQUERY, HTML and CSS
  regardless the site minimalistic visual approach
  (no font, no CSS details), thing that I did mostly with JQuery and JS
  having to load Dynamic Content and Handle API's calls
  through GET and POST methods. JS Code It's commented everywhere.

Issues
-HTML and CSS
  - Header with position: fixed overlaps or hiddes according to
    element below
  - In Cart Counter Animation the number does not stays centered
    while animation plays
  - Confirmation Animation does not stays centered while it plays
  - Hard time display side to side img and text in Product Cards
    in CHECKOUT.html
- JS
  - some items preview img's in PRODUCT.html do not load
    see comment in code (just first 3 img's)
  - hard time figuring out localStorage logic to pass data
    for Dynamic Content of CHECKOUT.HTML
